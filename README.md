## What is DEVHUB:

I'm not the author of DEVHUB, I was scrolling on Reddit, and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/lxtine/devhub_the_backend_only_social_media/) and I decided to try making a command line client for this app.

## How to use it:

- You just have to clone it and make sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed and also [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (the node package manager)
- then start the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
- then you can start `npm start` to start the project from you command line interface.

And you will see the code run in your command line interface, now you are ready to go!
